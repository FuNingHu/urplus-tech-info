Key Updates for PolyScopeX
==========================


1. **Focus on PolyScopeX**

   New UR+ product development should prioritize compatibility with PolyScope X. Products developed solely for PolyScope 5 may face limited relevance moving forward.

2. **Feature Alignment**

   PolyScope X differs in functionality from PolyScope 5. Partners must align early with UR+ Development Consultant to define required features and integration methods, as traditional approaches may not apply.

3. **Compatibility**

   URCaps developed for PolyScope 5 are **not compatible** with PolyScope X. Developers must create new URCaps specifically for PolyScope X or explore alternative integration methods. UR Script is compatible between PolyScope 5 and PolyScope X.

4. **Product Integration**

   While URCaps were previously central to integration, PolyScope X offers new pathways for product integration. After aligning with a UR+ engineer a URCap may no longer a strict requirement for UR+ Program participation. However, seamless setup and programming must still be ensured through sample programs, URScript code, modules, and comprehensive documentation.

5. **Expanded Product Information Requirements** - Hinting to Interfaces for Showroom

   To improve compatibility visibility across robot models and software versions, partners must now provide detailed interface information:

   * **Hardware Interfaces**

     * Connection to Robot Base
     * Connection to Tool Flange
     * Product Weight
     * Electrical Interface

   * **Software Interfaces**

     * PolyScope 5 URCap (if applicable)
     * PolyScope X URCap (if applicable)
     * PolyScope X General Integration Guide

6. **Product Lifecycle**

   Universal Robots plans to release a PolyScope X version every quarter, which introduces
   new features, overall improvements and/or bug fixes. Keeping compatibility between
   versions is one of the main goals when introducing a new release. But to still ensure
   the product's compatibility, continuous testing is highly recommended. In case a product
   is no longer compatible with the latest PolyScope X release, it may be removed from UR+.

.. note::
   Always backup your robot configuration before installing new URCaps.
