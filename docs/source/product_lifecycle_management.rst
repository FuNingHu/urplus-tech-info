Product Life Cycle Management (PLM)
====================================

A correct PLM workflow is crucial to product longevity and continuous smooth user experience and plays a key role in a successful UR+ Product. This section outlines the PLM framework for products developed within the Universal Robots ecosystem.

The core principle of this model is a partnership, in which the primary responsibility for the ongoing maintenance, evolution, and support of an ecosystem product resides with the respective Partner. Universal Robots acts as a steadfast enabler and technical supporter throughout this journey. This plan defines the structured channels and support mechanisms in place to ensure products remain robust, competitive, and valuable to end-users over time.

   </ol>


UR Technical Support for Enhancement & Expansion
-------------------------------------------------

In case an already existing UR+ Product should be getting an additional feature or receiving a major update, inform your UR Contacts about the plans. Depending on the details the UR technical support team may be available as an additional resource. Our support is aimed at helping Partners successfully realize their development goals. This involves:

* Providing API guidance, development best practices, and architectural consultation.
* Assisting in leveraging UR's latest platform features and hardware capabilities.
* Offering technical feedback to ensure new functionalities are optimized for a wider range of application scenarios, ultimately leading to a superior and more versatile user experience for the end-customer.


Bug Reporting & Quality Feedback Loop
--------------------------------------

Maintaining product quality is a shared priority. UR's technical and quality assurance teams actively monitor and test ecosystem products. During internal testing or through experiences from the field feedback (Bug reports, stability issue or potential performance improvements) may be provided. This feedback is being shared either through UR or directly from the party experiencing it. This information provides Partners with actionable insights to develop and issue fixes, patches, or improvements, thereby upholding the high-quality standard expected within the UR ecosystem.
