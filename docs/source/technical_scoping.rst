Technical Scoping
=================

This section outlines the technical scoping process for UR+ product development.

Overview
--------

Technical scoping is a critical first step in the UR+ development process. It ensures alignment between the partner's product vision and Universal Robots' technical requirements.

Scoping Meeting
---------------

Before development begins, partners must schedule a technical scoping meeting with a UR+ Development Consultant to:

* Define product functionality and use cases
* Identify integration methods (URCap, URScript, REST API, etc.)
* Clarify compatibility requirements (PolyScope 5, PolyScope X, robot models)
* Establish development timeline and milestones

Key Discussion Points
---------------------

1. **Product Description**

   * What does the product do?
   * What problem does it solve for the end user?
   * What are the primary use cases?

2. **Integration Method**

   * URCap development (PolyScope 5 / PolyScope X)
   * URScript integration
   * REST API communication
   * Fieldbus protocols (EtherNet/IP, PROFINET, Modbus, etc.)

3. **Hardware Requirements**

   * Physical connections (Tool flange, Robot base, External)
   * Electrical specifications (Voltage, Current, I/O)
   * Weight and payload considerations

4. **Software Requirements**

   * PolyScope version compatibility
   * Required robot features (Force/Torque, Safety functions, etc.)
   * Third-party dependencies

5. **Safety Considerations**

   * Risk assessment requirements
   * Safety-related functions
   * Compliance certifications needed

Deliverables from Scoping
-------------------------

After the scoping meeting, partners will receive:

* Technical requirements document
* Recommended integration approach
* Development timeline proposal
* List of required deliverables for certification

.. important::
   Technical scoping must be completed before starting URCap development. Changes to scope after development begins may result in delays.

Next Steps
----------

After completing technical scoping:

1. Review and confirm requirements document
2. Begin development according to agreed timeline
3. Schedule regular check-ins with UR+ Development Consultant
4. Prepare deliverables for testing phase
